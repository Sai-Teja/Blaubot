# Blaubot
Blaubot is a middleware to create small adhoc networks via P2P connections such as Bluetooth-RFCOMM, Adhoc-WiFi or simple socket connections. Blaubot takes care of device discovery and connection establishment with the goal to minimize a developer's boilerplate code to set up these small networks.

Tl;dr our main goal is to let a developer call `start();` and spare him as much hassle as possible to create ad hoc networks.
Blaubot is written in Java and has a dedicated version for Android (blaubot-android).

The documentation and a quick start guide can be found on the [project site](http://blaubot.hgross.eu/).
