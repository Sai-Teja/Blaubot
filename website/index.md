title: What is Blaubot?
noToc: true
---
Blaubot is a middleware to create small adhoc networks via P2P connections such as Bluetooth-RFCOMM, Adhoc-WiFi or simple socket connections. Blaubot takes care of device discovery and connection establishment with the goal to minimize a developer's boilerplate code to set up these small networks.

Tl;dr our main goal is to let a developer call `start();` and spare him as much hassle as possible to create ad hoc networks.
